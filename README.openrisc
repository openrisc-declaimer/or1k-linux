Initramfs
=========

In order to have the initramfs built into your kernel you need to have the following
options set:

CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="arch/or32/support/initramfs arch/or32/support/initramfs.devnodes"
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y

This builds the initramfs from the directory initramfs and adds some extra
directories and device nodes from the file initramfs.

There is not a hard dependency on devtmpfs, but it makes life easier and the initramfs
is configured to use it!
